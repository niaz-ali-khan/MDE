Project Domain: eHealth Management System

Short Description of the Project/Domain: The project is about an electronic health management system. The project is intended to demonstrate the interaction between user roles with the system interfaces. This model-driven engineering project covers the communication carried out between the users and project components. 

Assignment A1: In Assignment A1, basic meta classes are created for the domain-specific meta-model 

Note: Assignment 2 is done in 2 parts for some issues that arose while instantiating the model

Assignment A2 Part 1: EMF Modeling of EHealthManagement with EOL and EVL (EVL constraints did show some errors and behavioral issues due to  most likely Eclipse version issues)

Assignment A2 Part 2: The same EMF model as part 1 but metamodel is instantiated here with the concrete instances

Assignment A3: Refactoring of model from A2 with EGL and ETL. EGL works perfectly fine while there are some prevailing errors in model-to-model transformation.

Note: Assignment 4 is done in 2 parts becuase of the different tools Eclipse Modeling tool and Obeo Designer

Assignment A4 Part 1: In Assignment A4 part 1, a domain-specific language based on the electronic health management systems is implemented using a framework called XText. (There was some problems while testing the code perhaps due to tool version or any due to any step missing. We hope that it didn't impact the solution implemented)

Assignment A4 Part 2: In Assignment A4 Part 2, a domain-specific graphical editor is created using Sirius with Obeo Designer (The graphichal editor was having some issues but the steps to create Node representations, Edge representations (both relation-based and element-based), and Palette operators are performed completely.
